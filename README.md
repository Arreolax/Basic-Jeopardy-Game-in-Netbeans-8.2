# Basic-Jeopady-Game-in-Netbeans-8.2

The game allows two teams to choose which will have to answer a series of questions (4 categories of 5 questions each) and depending on whether they get it right it will be added or subtracted from their score.

It also has a section where you can edit the default questions so you can enter your own questions.
